# 🚌 Smart Transportation (bus-tracker) [view Prototype](https://demo-project-zeta-blush.vercel.app/)

A compact, frontend-focused bus tracking demo using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Leaflet** (via `react-leaflet`), and a minimal **Express + MongoDB** backend.  
This README explains how to set up, run, and extend the project, including how the map is integrated and how to add bus data.

## Theme : Governance 
## Problem Statement
In tier-2 and tier-3 cities, public bus transport systems lack real-time tracking and digital monitoring. Commuters face unpredictable bus arrival times, overcrowding, and long waiting periods, which leads to inconvenience and loss of trust in public transport. Due to this uncertainty, many people prefer private vehicles, increasing traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and environmental pollution.

Most existing transport solutions are designed for metro cities and rely on expensive GPS hardware and high-bandwidth infrastructure, making them unsuitable for smaller cities.

There is a strong need for a low-cost, scalable, and easy-to-adopt digital solution that can provide real-time bus location, estimated arrival times, and seat availability, while working efficiently in low-bandwidth environments and using minimal infrastructure.

## Solution
We propose a mobile and cloud-based real-time bus tracking system for tier-2 and tier-3 cities. The system has three components: a Conductor App that uses the conductor’s smartphone as a GPS tracker and enables digital ticketing, an Authority Dashboard to monitor buses, routes, and live locations, and a Passenger App/Web that shows real-time bus availability, ETA, and seat status.

The solution uses a Node.js backend to synchronize live data across all users, is low-cost, works in low-bandwidth environments, and can be deployed quickly without expensive GPS hardware—making public transport more reliable, efficient, and commuter-friendly.

##  Project Summary

- **Frontend:** React + Vite, located in the workspace root.  
  Components and pages are under [`client/src`](client/src).

- **Map:** Uses `leaflet` and `react-leaflet` to render live markers and popups.  
  See [`client/src/components/MapComponent.tsx`](client/src/components/MapComponent.tsx#L1).

- **Backend:** Node/Express with MongoDB  
  Mongoose models in [`server/src/models.ts`](server/src/models.ts#L1).  
  Scripted seeding available at [`server/src/scripts/seed.ts`](server/src/scripts/seed.ts#L1).

##  Features

- Live-looking map with markers and popups showing seat availability and traffic  
- Tile switcher (OSM / Carto Positron / Stamen Toner)  
- Locate button, availability filter, and legend  
- Mock data in [`client/src/data/mockBuses.ts`](client/src/data/mockBuses.ts#L1)  
- Server-side seed script mirrors the same buses  
- Booking uses an atomic endpoint  
  `POST /api/buses/:id/book` (created to prevent race conditions)  
- UI components use **React Query**, so updates propagate across pages in real time


##  Prerequisites

- Node.js (16+ recommended) and `npm` or `pnpm`
- MongoDB running locally  
  *(or provide a remote URI in `server/.env`)*

##  Quick Start — Install

# 1. Install frontend dependencies  
*(root contains frontend `package.json`)*

npm install
# 2. Install server dependencies

- cd server
- npm install


# 3. Environment
- Copy or edit server/.env

Set:
MONGODB_URI (default included)
PORT (defaults to 5000)
NODE_ENV

# 4. Seeding the Database
- Seed the database with the included example buses
(this clears existing bus documents)

- cd server
- npm run seed

# 5. Development — Running the App
- Run the server (dev mode, uses tsx watcher)
  
- cd server
- npm run dev

- Run the frontend (Vite) from repo root

- npm run dev


# 6.Building / Preview
- Build frontend

- npm run build
Build server and run (if needed)

- cd server
npm run build
npm start

# 7. How the Map Is Added
- Libraries:
leaflet and react-leaflet
(see dependencies in root package.json)
The component imports leaflet/dist/leaflet.css for map styles.

- Component:
MapComponent
(client/src/components/MapComponent.tsx)
Renders MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, and Popup.

- Tiles:
Default uses OpenStreetMap tiles, with options to switch to
Carto Positron or Stamen Toner.

- Markers & Icons:
Custom divIcons show availability color and bus ID suffix.
Includes a fix for Leaflet’s icon image URLs to work with bundlers.

- Data:
When not provided via props, MapComponent uses mockBuses from
client/src/data/mockBuses.ts.
Each bus includes latitude and longitude fields.

- Fit & Update:
A small internal MapUpdater uses useMap() to fit bounds to current markers when locations change.

# 8. Adding or Updating Bus Data
Frontend (mock data)
Edit client/src/data/mockBuses.ts

### Each object should include:<br>

a. number<br>
b. route<br>
c. seats<br>
d. available<br>
e. timing<br>
f. traffic<br>
g. location<br>
h. trafficStatus (light | moderate | heavy)<br>
i. latitude<br>
j. longitude<br>

- Server (seeded data)<br>
Update server/src/scripts/seed.ts
- Then run:<br>
npm run seed

- API Notes<br>
Backend models are defined in
server/src/models.ts

- Add endpoints in: <br>
server/src/routes.ts
or expand routes.ts as needed.

# 9. Testing
### Server includes:

-npm run test-api
Runs a small script test-api.js to exercise endpoints.

# 10. Possible Improvements / Next Steps
- Add marker clustering (e.g., leaflet.markercluster)

- Add live updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

- Add route polylines and vehicle headings for richer visualization

# 🚌 Raahi Punjab – Real-Time Public Transport Tracking System

## 📌 Problem Statement
In tier-2 and tier-3 cities, public transport systems lack real-time visibility. Commuters face unpredictable bus arrival times, overcrowding, and long waiting periods. This reduces trust in public transport and pushes people toward private vehicles, increasing traffic congestion and pollution.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Raahi Punjab is a mobile-based real-time bus tracking system designed for small cities and towns. Instead of installing expensive GPS hardware, the system uses the conductor’s smartphone as a live tracker.

### Components:
1. **Conductor App** – Live location sharing, digital ticketing, seat availability  
2. **Passenger App** – Live bus tracking, ETA, route info  
3. **Authority Dashboard** – Fleet monitoring, route analytics  

## 🧠 Innovation
- No GPS hardware required  
- Low-cost and scalable  
- Optimized for low bandwidth  
- Multilingual support  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: Flutter / React Native, React.js  
- Backend: Node.js  
- Database: Firebase Realtime DB, Firestore  
- Cloud: Firebase  

## 🌱 Impact
- Reduced waiting time  
- Better public transport adoption  
- Reduced pollution
